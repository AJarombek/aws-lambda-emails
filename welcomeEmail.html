                Thank you for subscribing to Andrew Jarombek's software development website!
            </p>
            <p>
                I started developing software the summer of 2016.  This website is the central hub
                for all the work I do and love.  I am really excited you are joining me on my Software
                Development journey!
            </p>
            <p>
                Every month I will send you an email with updates on my progress and cool technologies
                I discovered.  I am trying to write 1-2 blog posts a week, and I will inform you about
                those as well.  Also included will be updates on the website and some of my other
                applications!
            </p>

                Please confirm your email address by clicking the link below.  For now this will do nothing,
                but in the future you will have the ability to comment on my blog posts and more!
